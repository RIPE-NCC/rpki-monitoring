# Spring Boot always loads `application.yaml`. Afterwards the settings are loaded for the active profile. These are
# merged: By default, `application.yaml` is loaded and `application-default.yaml` extends it.
#
# The default for naming is 'lower-case kebab format' such as 'my.proper-tyname=acme' as recommended in [0].
